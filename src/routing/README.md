> Declarative, extensible route matching and configuration for ContextJS-based applications.

## ‚ú® Features

- Fully type-safe and fluent route configuration
- Support for literal, parameterized, optional, and catch-all route templates
- Fast route matching with scoring and early-exit optimization
- URI decoding, normalization, and edge-case tolerance
- Integration with the `Application` class via `useRouting()`

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm i @contextjs/routing
```

## üöÄ Usage

```ts
import { Application } from "@contextjs/system";
import { RouteInfo } from "@contextjs/routing";

const app = new Application();
app.useRouting();
```

## üîç Matching Example

```ts
import { RouteService } from "@contextjs/routing";

const route = RouteService.match("home/123/details", [...routeDefinitions]);

console.log(route?.template); // "home/{id?}/details"
```

## üìò API Reference

### Decorator

```ts
/**
 * Decorates a method as a route handler.
 * @param template The URL template for the route.
 * @param name The name of the route (optional).
 */
export declare function Route(template: string, name?: string): MethodDecorator;
```

### `RouteInfo`

Represents a route with a URL template and optional name.

```ts
new RouteInfo(template: string);
new RouteInfo(template: string, name: string);
```

- `template`: The route‚Äôs URL template (e.g., `"users/{id}"`)
- `name`: Optional route name

### `RouteService`

Provides matching logic to resolve a route from a path.

```ts
public static match(value: string, routes: RouteDefinition[]): RouteDefinition | null;
```

- `path`: Request path (e.g., `"users/42"`)
- `routes`: Array of `RouteDefinition` instances to search
- **Returns**: the best match or `null` if no match

### `Application.useRouting`

Adds routing configuration to the ContextJS `Application`.

```ts
app.useRouting();
```


### `RouteDefinition`
```ts
/**
 * Represents a route definition, including the import path, class reference, method name, and route information.
 */
export declare class RouteDefinition<T extends RouteInfo = RouteInfo> {
    /** The path to the module where the route is defined. */
    public importPath: string;
    /** The class reference for the route handler. */
    public classReference: Function | null;
    /** The method in the class that handles the route. */
    public methodReference: Function | null;
    /** The route information. */
    public route: T;

    /**
     * Creates a new route definition.
     * @param importPath The path to the module where the route is defined.
     * @param classReference The class reference for the route handler.
     * @param methodReference The method in the class that handles the route.
     * @param route The route information.
     */
    constructor(importPath: string, classReference: Function | null, methodReference: Function | null, route: T);
}
```
